       <h2>Sunflowers</h2>
        Van gogh's paintings of sunflowers are among his most famous. He did them in Arles, in the south of france, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow 'and nothing else'.In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single color, without any loss of eloquence.
